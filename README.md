# Business-Card-OCR

This was a short project I wrote to show display my skill for Asymmetrik. A further description of the project can be found at http://asymmetrik.com/programming-challenges/ .

To run this project you can place all the files located here in a central directory and then running on a command like by first running make and then driver.out card[1-3].txt peopleNames.txt .

Otherwise you can load the files into an IDE like Visual Studio and run it inside of there. Be sure to set your command line arguments whe using Vistual Studio by right clicking your project name in the Solution Explorer, choosing Properties, then go into Debugging and set your command line arguments to card[1-3].txt peopleNames.txt .

Thanks for checking this out!

*** I wrote this program when I was a bit newer to programming and honestly did it in one of the most complex possible ways. Please review my Biz-OCR-Python repo for a much simpler method of accomplishing this. ***
